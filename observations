Quick observations based on the data collected:
-Smaller schools lead to smaller classes. And smaller classes lead to higher scores and a higher overall passing percentage.
-Charter schools perform better than district schools, regardless of budget. One could only conclude that is largely due to class size.
-Charters do more with less money than district schools do.
